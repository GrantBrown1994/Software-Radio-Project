In this 6-part final project we have demonstrated understanding of the basics of software radio systems. We have explored the architectures for transmitter-channel-receiver systems, as well as common issues that may occur in these systems. We have equalized channel distortion using symbol and fractionally spaced equalizers. Results show that while symbol-spaced equalizers bare minimum complexity the advantages of the fractionally-spaced equalizer out-weight its added complexity. To solve non-ideal transmitter and receiver structures, we have utilized pilot and decision-directed methods to fix timing phase, constellation rotation, and carrier recovery. This has allowed for us to overcome common issues such as crystal oscillator imperfections to extract transmitted data at the output of the equalizer. 

Professor Fahrang, thank you for the great semester and patience as we learn the material. I greatly enjoyed the class and I am looking forward to learning more on this topic over time with your guidance.
