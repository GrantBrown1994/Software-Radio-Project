This work aims to develop the receiver portion of a software radio. It must take into account real-world issues encountered in software radio's, such as: carrier offset and timing phase offset due to crystal oscillator imperfections, as well as distortion introduced by various transmission mediums. In part I of the project the students must demodulate a undisturbed transmitted signal to baseband, acquire the optimal timing phase associated with the transmitted symbols, and extract the specified data. Part II and III of the project uses a channel that introduces distortion and the students must create a symbol-spaced equalizer and fractionally-spaced equalized to restore the Nyquist pulse. Part IV of the project introduces a carrier offset and phase drift into the transmitted data, requiring a carrier acquisition and tracking method to restore the symbols. Part V introduces a non-zero timing phase into the design and requires a symbol rate tracker to be implemented. Part VI is optional and utilizes an equalizer to perform tracking for carrier and timing phase offsets.
